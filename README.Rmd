# Bayesian Psychometrics for Dynamic Learning Maps: A Proof of Concept

This repository contains the source code for the Technical Report, *Bayesian psychometrics for Dynamic Learning Maps: A proof of concept*. The report is powered by [**bookdown**](https://bookdown.org), which makes it easy to turn R markdown files into PDF.

This report was built with:

```{r}
devtools::session_info(c("ratlas", "knitr", "english", "kableExtra",
                         "tidyverse", "rstan", "loo", "tidybayes", "here"))
